</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h2>April 12th Event</h2>
<p>So I was able to get in contact with Mike at the San Francisco Coder Dojo. He is the guy I talked to at the Geeks 4 Good Jam earlier.
I showed up a little early and found a few people sanding outside the door. I had hoped that by getting there early I could help 
with any setup, but no one could enter the space early so I just hung out. Mike was already there too and was trying to get access. The
space is the headquarters of GitHub, and there needs to be an employee there to let us in. An employee never showed up, but somehow the
head of building security was contacted and a security guard let us into the main room. </p>
<p>Wow does GitHub have a nice office! Their bar was super impressive. I kinda wish I took a photo. I work a lame corporation, and it really
hit that I am missing out on the startup life.</p>
<p>Anyway, there wasn't anything to setup. The main GitHub room that we use is meant for presentations so there was already tables and chairs
out for everyone to use. Mike setup the projection stuff and I shyly introduced myself to the other volunteer mentors. I think there 
were 8 mentors there? There was about 20 kids I believe. I should have written this earlier, I have such a lame memory. Anyway, there were
plenty of mentors there, so I was feeling pretty good. It was my first time doing something like this, so it was good to know that there
would be people there that I could ask for help or follow their example as needed. </p>
<h2>Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors in Javascript</h2>
<p>Mike lead the event by going to http://code.org and having the kids warm up by solving some programming puzzles there. The site reminds me
of the Alice environment that I used for one semester back at Chabot College. Very easy for the kids to use, and there are a lot of Angry Birds
images to get them focused.</p>
<p>Later he brought everyone to http://jsbin.com and started walking everyone through the basics of Javascript and functions.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>Around here people started to need help. He asked the kids to type out something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">var</span> <span class="n">answer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">prompt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Want to play a game?&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">answer</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="s">&quot;yes&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;lets play!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>One kid was using an iPad for the day. When he typed "yes" into the prompt, the apple software keyboard was capitalizing the first letter.
I was afraid that my explination of "yes and Yes are different to a computer" would provoke some kind of unhappy response. Instead, for
this problem and others, both adults and kids seemed to just accept the situation as-is. Few people seemed frustrated when issues arose.
Also long as a mentor came over and helped, everyone seemed pretty happy.</p>
<h2>Learning Javascript</h2>
<p>At the end, everyone needed help with the part that uses some nested if-statements to decide if rock or paper or scissors won. For the
younger kids, I don't think they really understood what was happening in the code. They just wanted to be able to type stuff and see
something happen. There were a few older kids who seemed to be catching on. I hope those kids continue with coding and make something
cool! </p>
<p>One of the kids already had experience with ActionScript. He wrote a function definition that declared a return type, I was impressed.</p>                </article>

playing games. I remember ...</p>
