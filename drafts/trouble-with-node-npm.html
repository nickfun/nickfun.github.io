<p>I've been having trouble getting Node and the related ecosystem to work, I thought I would document what I've been trying.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>I have a simple Linde VPM running Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS. I want to use grunt to concat and minify my javascript app, and also 
precompile my lodash templates. I do this at work on my Windows 7 workstation. I had hoped it would be easy to setup on my VPS
so that I could develop side projects and play around with related tech.</p>
<h2>Easy at first</h2>
<p>Getting Node and npm installed on the machine was easy. I love Debian-based distros because you can just <code>apt-get</code> everything and
it works great. So I installed Node and then npm using apt-get. Things seemed fine, but I could not install <code>grunt-cli</code>. The error
messages that npm puts out are long and confusing as they include a stack trace.</p>
<p>The problem was that my version of Node was too old to run grunt. I had 0.6 installed and 0.8 is required for grunt.</p>
<h2>Upgrade time</h2>
<p>I went to the Node homepage and was happy to see that they provide linux binaries for download. /I don't have to compile from souce!/
I extracted the files and found the binary that I needed. I added a link to it in my path and tried it out. <code>node --version</code> 
reported that I am now running version 0.10. /Sweet/. But when I ran npm to install grunt, I was getting the same error.</p>
