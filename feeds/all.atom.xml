A few times, I've decided to just write a quick
python script to rename what I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Emacs user, I figured there must be a better way. You can use &lt;code&gt;dired&lt;/code&gt; mode to rename files in bulk. I'm using Emacs 24.3.1 on Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call dired mode on the folder with the files you want to rename&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enter "Editable Dired" mode by using &lt;code&gt;M-x wdired-change-to-wdired-mode&lt;/code&gt; or you can use the key chord &lt;code&gt;C-c C-q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now edit the names of the files however you like. I often just need to use &lt;code&gt;M-x replace-string&lt;/code&gt; on the buffer. You can also use other text editing tools. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The edits you make are not live, you must commit your changes with &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt; or abort all your changes with &lt;code&gt;C-c ESC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs continues to be great :-)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="emacs"></category></entry><entry><title>Freemarker template inheritance</title><link href="https://nickfun.github.io/posts/2014/freemarker-template-inheritance.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-09T15:04:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Nick Fun</name></author><id>tag:https://nickfun.github.io,2014-10-09:posts/2014/freemarker-template-inheritance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Template systems like Twig in PHP and Jinja in Python allow for templates to inherit from a base template. In Freemarker you can do something similar but you have to set it up yourself using the macro system. At work we are using &lt;a href="http://freemarker.org/"&gt;Freemarker&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://www.dropwizard.io/"&gt;Dropwizard&lt;/a&gt;. I was familiar with Twig and was hoping that we can get a simliar inheritance system in Freemarker. It's not in the docs, but it is possible to have the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freemarker lets you do some neat stuff. You can have a "base" template that defines the overall page structure, and then the actual template you want to write can just fill in the pieces. Here is how that will look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;base.ftl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page_head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/css/default.css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Basic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;display_page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;doctype&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page_head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/js/tracking.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;nav&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user.ftl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;base.ftl&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page_head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/js/user.min.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;display_page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Freemarker provides a powerful macro system that allows us to implement template inheritance. In base.ftl we define a few macros for the head and body of the page. Then we define the &lt;code&gt;display_page&lt;/code&gt; macro to wrap the head and body. In &lt;code&gt;display_page&lt;/code&gt; we get to define the basic structure of the page and include common things, like a user tracking code or page navigation. Templates can define what goes in the head and body by extending the base file, define their own macro named &lt;code&gt;page_head&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;page_body&lt;/code&gt;, this overrides the macros defined in base.tpl, then call the wrapping macro &lt;code&gt;display_page&lt;/code&gt;. There can be more than one base template, and different page templates can include the one that works best for them. So we could have a &lt;code&gt;public_base.ftl&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;admin_base.ftl&lt;/code&gt; that define different wrappers but the individual templates still define their own head, body, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other template systems you are provided a &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; method along with &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; tags to build up this kind of structure. In Freemarker it is still possible but you have to jump through the hoop of setting up macros to do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Default Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, &lt;code&gt;user.ftl&lt;/code&gt; redefines the &lt;code&gt;page_head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;page_body&lt;/code&gt; macro. If the &lt;code&gt;page_head&lt;/code&gt; macro was not defined in &lt;code&gt;user.ftl&lt;/code&gt;, then Freemarker would default to the macro defined in &lt;code&gt;base.ftl&lt;/code&gt;. What if we want access to that macro in &lt;code&gt;user.ftl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; we want to incorporate it into our own &lt;code&gt;page_head&lt;/code&gt; macro? In the Twig template system you can use the &lt;code&gt;{{ parent() }}&lt;/code&gt; tag to include it. In Freemarker, once we overwrite it, it is gone. So we need to get around it manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to do this is to define another macro and give it a prefix. I'll make a &lt;code&gt;page_head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;common_page_head&lt;/code&gt;. In the base template we define the default &lt;code&gt;page_head&lt;/code&gt; to just include &lt;code&gt;common_page_head&lt;/code&gt; and if we redefine the macro in a child template then we can call the common macro if we need it, recreating the feature of &lt;code&gt;{{ parent() }}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;base.ftl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;common_page_head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;charset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page_head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;common_page_head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Basic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;display_page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/js/user.min.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;#macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;display_page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a &lt;code&gt;common_page_head&lt;/code&gt; macro, I can put anything common to all the page heads in there. By default, if a template does not define a &lt;code&gt;page_head&lt;/code&gt; macro we get &lt;code&gt;common_page_head&lt;/code&gt; output. If a template does redefine the head macro then they have the option of including the common stuff. It's kind of annoying to have to define these extra macros when other template systems have the functions built in. But Freemarker is a popular system in Java and I don't see any other major template library that has inheritance built in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using &lt;a href="http://www.getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; to build this site. It's pretty great and I'd like to share the
config that I am using for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/nickfun/d58cb72e507ac02ffcc2"&gt;pelicanconf.py config file&lt;/a&gt; is hosted as a gist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican comes with some great defaults, I have not had to make many changes.
Most changes are for how the markdown posts are renamed when generated to html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ARTICLE_URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;posts/{date:%Y}/{slug}.html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ARTICLE_SAVE_AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;posts/{date:%Y}/{slug}.html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ARCHIVES_SAVE_AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;posts/index.html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;YEAR_ARCHIVE_SAVE_AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;posts/{date:%Y}/index.html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ARCHIVES_URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;posts/index.html&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the above config, a post I made on July 17, 2013 with a title of "first post" will be saved to /posts/2013/first-post.html and it will have the same URL. The yearly archive is /posts/2013/index.html. This is nice because when reading the article anyone can just delete the post title from the URL and get the archive for the year. I do not write enough to worry about breaking the yearly archive into monthly archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The template that I use, &lt;a href="https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3"&gt;pelican-bootstrap3&lt;/a&gt;, defaults the archive URL to &lt;code&gt;archive.html&lt;/code&gt;, so I have to override it with the &lt;code&gt;ARCHIVES_URL&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting to me that I have to config both the URL and the SAVE_AS path for an article. On a static site these will always be the same thing. Whats the advantage to configuring these separately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great thing about the pelican-bootstrap3 theme is that it comes with many
sub-themes that can be toggled with the &lt;code&gt;BOOTSTRAP_THEME&lt;/code&gt; variable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've really enjoyed using pelican to generate this site. If I had to maintain
another site I would definitely start with pelican and see if I could get
away with using it. A static site is a great way to publish information and
can be very cheaply hosted on S3.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Big Data at Work</title><link href="https://nickfun.github.io/posts/2014/big-data-at-work.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-26T11:26:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Nick Fun</name></author><id>tag:https://nickfun.github.io,2014-07-26:posts/2014/big-data-at-work.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Situation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work we are concerned about the amount of data that our next project will generate. After
the system is up with a few thousand customers we are estimating that we could be getting 10GB
of data per day. This volume of data goes beyond our level of experience, and we are looking
for new systems to help us deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My coworker has been charged with deciding on the database system to use to store the bulk
of the data that will be coming in. It is all "log" style data: thousands of devices will
report in and we will store the data for later aggregation. Once the data is reported it becomes
historical and will not be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hadoop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hadoop name is very closely associated with the "big data" world and my coworker has spent
a lot of time diving into it. However, it's a diverse ecosystem and there are many systems
and subsystems that come into play. Mostly he has focused on the HBase system to organize
our data in a column-oriented database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been two major problems with HBase. The first is conceptual. Neither he nor anyone
else on the team has experience with column-oriented databases. We all have strong backgrounds
in relational databases with tables and schema. HBase represents a different way of thinking
and we while we have ideas on how to use it in our project, we don't know if we are making
good decisions. Additionally, without operational experience, we have had a lot of difficulty
just getting the system installed and working. There are many vendors and packaged versions
of Hadoop + HBase with monitoring and management consoles, and they have all given us different
frustrations with attempting to get them to work. It has been slow going and the project needs
to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other problem, possibly related to the first, is performance. After HBase has been setup
and filled with some test data for us to play with, the time to get results is unacceptable.
Just doing the equivalent of "SELECT * FROM TABLE" took 20 seconds on a system with about 800
rows. While we are not experts, it's hard to imagine us setting up a system so unoptimized that
a simple operation could take so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While considering the HBase system he also looked at other NoSQL options. SpliceMachine looked
promising but is very new and we fear it is not battle tested yet. Other systems had various
shortcomings in how data is stored or retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache Cassandra was evaluated briefly but rejected. Cassandra has an "eventual consistency"
system that my coworker found very suspicious. Also, Cassandra allows for only one column
family while HBase can have multiple. Personally I feel Cassandra should be given another
look, but it still brings with it a large learning curve and mental shift to NoSQL ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big Relational&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current front-runner is MySQL in the form of a Galera cluster of MariaDB instances. We
hope this will allow us to scale our current understanding of databases to deal with the increase
in data. If we can find a good criteria to shard our data, we will then use Galera to provide
robustness and high uptime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Never Enough Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project we are working on has a pretty strict deadline. Our team isn't known for hitting
deadlines and I worry that we won't have enough time to really vet a database solution. The
database that we choose will be the backbone of the whole system, so it's very important to get
it right. Even after meeting with multiple NoSQL vendors like HortonWorks and Cloudera, we still
do not feel confident using a NoSQL system. However, I'm not convinced that sticking with MySQL
is a real win either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search continues.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="database"></category><category term="sql"></category><category term="big-data"></category></entry><entry><title>Need better tools at work</title><link href="https://nickfun.github.io/posts/2014/need-better-tools-at-work.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-06-20T22:22:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Nick Fun</name></author><id>tag:https://nickfun.github.io,2014-06-20:posts/2014/need-better-tools-at-work.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Right tool for the job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work we really need some better tools. Testing our programs is just not easy when all you have is the program.
It can take a while to manually put it into the state that you need to test. Currently we do not use any automated
systems for testing. The only exception is a small tool that I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Existing tooling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the only tool we have at our disposal is a crummy PHP app I wrote that runs on the command line.
I use it to simulate vehicles being in trip so that I can test the big map page and ensure that it draws
vehicles moving around correctly. I remember a co-worker of mine saying he would often have to test the map
page at 5pm when everyone was driving home. I knew that was not a good solution to testing stuff, so I wrote
a simple thing to manipulate the database in a way that simulates vehicles driving around. It has come in 
handy &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; times. Back when I was doing full-time development on the big map page I was using it all day
every day for weeks at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only regret about the trip faker tool is that I never pushed to get the others to use it. I should have 
written up a document and sent it around. However, I am the lead dev for that, so even if others knew
how it worked it would still be mostly me using it. Also, it's usage is not very intuitive so I doubt the
rest of the team would be thrilled to learn it's quirks. That is a lesson for me when I make the next tool. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have built a few small things that need to be expanded into more usable tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Report Stress Tester&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a little PHP page that generates a lot of requests for reports to be generated. I like that it fully 
simulates how a report would be requested. However, it exists in a page in my folder on the dev server and
will never be pushed to the DEV or LIVE environment. I will need to integrate it into a admin page if I want
others to even consider using it. Also, it generates a lot of data, it would be a good idea to have a way
to clean up all the stress reports it created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Device Network Simulator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have hardware simulators that pretend to be a car engine that present a OBDII port. However, they do not let us
fake data such as GPS location, timestamps, and other events. Plus they often do not get good cell reception
in our part of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I built a simple (too simple) Java app that reads a input file and sends the data over the network to the 
back-end service to simulate network traffic from a device. The input file must contain everything &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; as you
want it to be sent. I need to upgrade this to take care of things like &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timestamps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPS in normal lat/lng format instead of raw hex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increment sequence numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to build a simple GUI with it that can give some graphical feedback as it processes the file
and sends the data. This would be really, really helpful when developing the back-end service. Currently the boss
just uses the hardware simulator when he developers, but as I said there are many limits to that way. Additionally,
when the QA team needs to test something specific, the hardware simulator usually can't reproduce a scenario exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest tools we need are already out there ready for us to use. Our main web app has no automated tests
and there are many products that can be applied. We have looked at Selenium and Jazz Automation. The team really
needs to set some time aside and decide which tool will work for us and get it into our workflow. Until we do,
we are spending a lot of time doing things manually that could be automated. I really want automated tests so that
we can catch bugs! It's really frustrating going to a page and finding that something is broken that used to work. 
Annoying!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will soon be working on a weather project. I will keep my eyes open for tools to develop that can help us 
build and test the new system.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="work"></category><category term="java"></category></entry><entry><title>Emacs</title><link href="https://nickfun.github.io/posts/2014/emacs.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-05-11T23:01:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Nick Fun</name></author><id>tag:https://nickfun.github.io,2014-05-11:posts/2014/emacs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I believe I first used emacs back in my community college days. I had access to
a Linux machine for a few classes. We often worked in the terminal and I needed
a good text editor. I have tried vi &amp;amp; vim several times, but I could never get
used to the idea of several modes. I would often switch to a different mode
unexpectedly and things would get really bad. I never had &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; problem with
emacs, so I would usually use emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I tried diving in to emacs to see what I could get it to do. I knew
it had a reputation for extensions and while I wasn't planning on writing my own
I wanted to take advantage of anything that was out there. While reading some
docs I found out how to split the window and view two files at the same time.
That was when I decided to never even try vim again and to stay away from nano/pico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My decision was justified once I learned about org-mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work I have been using Org-mode to keep track of my time. Our bug tracker, Redmine,
lets you log time for how long a bug takes. The boss has asked us to submit a time with
bugs that we close. Org-mode makes it wicked easy to add task, clock in, and generate
a report when needed. I've got a giant file that I've been keeping since the beginning
of the year, 5 months ago. I should look into how to split it into different files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time to go all in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I saw the "Emacs Rocks" video that showed multiple-cursors mode. I knew then
that it was time to go all-in with emacs. Sublime text has been my main code editor
since at least 2011. I have become very productive in it because of its built-in multi 
cursor support. I had never used a system like that before and it was easy to see
how I could use it to speed up dealing with code in patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't yet taken the time to setup multiple-cursors mode, but I am investing more in 
emacs. I have it setup on my personal computers now. I setup the marmalade repo to 
easily install plug-ins. I have chosen a theme to run with (zenburn) and will try
to move myself into a emacs way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emacs Lisp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to learn Lisp or Scheme. In my Programming Language Concepts class
in University we were given an intro to Scheme. I was pretty blown away by how different
the language was to everything else I had used at that point. I was a pretty good
programmer, but I had trouble wrapping my mind around Scheme. I have wanted to spend
more time with it ever since, and I've never really been able to take it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs is famous for having its own Lisp built in: elisp. Sadly, the language is really
old and it has not evolved along with other languages. I understand the variable scope
system is weird in elisp and it has bad support for namespaces. However, I still want
to learn it. It will be profitable for me to learn to extend emacs, and I fill finally
get to learn a lisp! I'm rather excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a "Intro to elisp" manual that GNU published a few years ago that they give
away for free. I am slowly working through it. I keep a "stuff" repo on GitHub that
I use for experiments. My plan now is that all my experiments will be Emacs oriented.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Switching to Java at work</title><link href="https://nickfun.github.io/posts/2014/switching-to-java-at-work.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-05-08T13:37:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Nick Fun</name></author><id>tag:https://nickfun.github.io,2014-05-08:posts/2014/switching-to-java-at-work.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So at my day job I have always used PHP for back-end work. But I am happy so say that I finally get to expand into Java for
some things! I know that Java as a language is not the hottest thing anymore, but I think it is really good for me to
move away from PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transition away&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have a network server written in Java: the "ATP Client" and now we are expanding to at least one more Java
system and maybe another. My coworker and I are building a reporting system in Java. It is rather boring and complex
but I'm happy to be moving into a "real" language because PHP just can't deal with the things we want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP is the worst environment to do background processing. We want Reports and a few other things to run in the background,
so we have to bring in something better. Pretty much everything is better than PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad that we are introducing more Java into the project. Currently, the report server runs inside Tomcat so that
we can communicate with it over HTTP. There is talk of bringing in RabbitMQ, and I really hope it happens. Then we can
drop Tomcat and just communicate with the report server on the message queue. That will be cleaner, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I think we will have to re-write all of the web back-end, and I hope we get to do that in a language other
than PHP also. I think Groovy or Python would be a great fit for us. We can keep coding without worrying about types
or defining our data structures with classes, and we will have better access to background processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dev notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using Netbeans to develop or new java code. The boss, who wrote the current Java network server, doesn't use a 
full IDE for development. He uses UEEditor I think. It's like a super-powered version of Notepad++. I like Netbeans a lot
and it has been pretty smooth. I love that now I can setup unit tests and easily run them. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>I'm a Coder Dojo Mentor</title><link href="https://nickfun.github.io/posts/2014/im-a-coder-dojo-mentor.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-21T16:54:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Nick Fun</name></author><id>tag:https://nickfun.github.io,2014-04-21:posts/2014/im-a-coder-dojo-mentor.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;April 12th Event&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was able to get in contact with Mike at the San Francisco Coder Dojo. He is the guy I talked to at the Geeks 4 Good Jam earlier.
I showed up a little early and found a few people sanding outside the door. I had hoped that by getting there early I could help 
with any setup, but no one could enter the space early so I just hung out. Mike was already there too and was trying to get access. 
The space is the headquarters of GitHub, and there needs to be an employee there to let us in. An employee never showed up, but 
somehow the head of building security was contacted and a security guard let us into the main room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow does GitHub have a nice office! Their bar was super impressive. I kinda wish I took a photo. I work a lame corporation, and it 
really hit that I am missing out on the startup life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there wasn't anything to setup. The main GitHub room that we use is meant for presentations so there was already tables 
and chairs out for everyone to use. Mike setup the projection stuff and I shyly introduced myself to the other volunteer mentors. 
I think there were 8 mentors there? There was about 20 kids I believe. I should have written this earlier, I have such a lame 
memory. Anyway, there were plenty of mentors there, so I was feeling pretty good. It was my first time doing something like this, 
so it was good to know that there would be people there that I could ask for help or follow their example as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors in Javascript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike lead the event by going to http://code.org and having the kids warm up by solving some programming puzzles there. The site 
reminds me of the Alice environment that I used for one semester back at Chabot College. Very easy for the kids to use, and there 
are a lot of Angry Birds images to get them focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later he brought everyone to http://jsbin.com and started walking everyone through the basics of Javascript and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around here people started to need help. He asked the kids to type out something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;prompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Want to play a game?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;lets play!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One kid was using an iPad for the day. When he typed "yes" into the prompt, the apple software keyboard was capitalizing the 
first letter. I was afraid that my explanation of "yes and Yes are different to a computer" would provoke some kind of unhappy 
response. Instead, for this problem and others, both adults and kids seemed to just accept the situation as-is. Few people 
seemed frustrated when issues arose. Also long as a mentor came over and helped, everyone seemed pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning Javascript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, everyone needed help with the part that uses some nested if-statements to decide if rock or paper or scissors won. For the
younger kids, I don't think they really understood what was happening in the code. They just wanted to be able to type stuff and see
something happen. There were a few older kids who seemed to be catching on. I hope those kids continue with coding and make something
cool! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the kids already had experience with ActionScript. He wrote a function definition that declared a return type, I was impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used jsbin.com as the Javascript environment. Everyone got the idea of typing code and running it to see results in the 
console tab. However, jsbin will insert a closing bracket or parenthesis when you type an opening one and it often lead to 
problems. At the end, many kids had extra { and ( lying around in their code. It was difficult to explain that this was causing 
issues. When I instructed the kids to remove or move them around they quickly did as I asked and where happy when their program 
worked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very pleased with how the event went! The kids enjoyed their time and I was surprised at how willing they were to follow
our instructions and attempt the work we gave them. At the end the kids had used up their attention span and were ready to 
either run around or play minecraft, but two hours of their time was pretty good I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted with Mike at the end and he told me more about the Coder Dojo organization. I seems that right now here is the
number one guy to organize everything and is looking for help. He also said that often the ratio of kids to mentors is
not as good as it was today. I plan on going to the next event and I hope I see some of the students there again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Geeks 4 Good jam</title><link href="https://nickfun.github.io/posts/2014/geeks-4-good-jam.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-20T18:10:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Nick Fun</name></author><id>tag:https://nickfun.github.io,2014-03-20:posts/2014/geeks-4-good-jam.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I went to the Geeks 4 Good Jam. I got an invite on Facebook from an old classmate of mine. I was 
eager to reconnect with her and also get some leads on good projects I could work on. The event was about letting
developers know of organizations that can use tech help to do good things. I am an Eagle Scout, so doing volunteer work is
something that I am used to, and I am sad to say that I have not been doing any lately. This seemed like a great
opportunity for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Presentations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived a bit late and missed the first speaker. He was talking about working at a hospital, or doing something
in the health care industry? I don't know. He had a link on his slides to &lt;a href="http://github.com/hy"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; but I went
there and didn't see any information about an organization. Not clear how I could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other presenters were ChickTech, Coder Dojo, Social Coding 4 good, SF Public Press, and Coders For America (?). They all
seemed really cool. I don't know if I could really contribute to ChickTech since they focus on high school girls. Could I
really make a difference, as a guy, if I mentored a young girl? It seemed that they got the most out of having adult females
give advice to the girls. The other orgs seemed interesting, but had vague goals and it wasn't clear if I could &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted with the guy from Coder Dojo about their "mentor" system. At Coder Dojo, a mentor is mostly just an experienced 
developer who can help kids with projects and lessons that are planned out by a teacher. It seems that any mentor can become
a teacher after a short while, so there is no big process around it. After talking to him, it seemed like the kind of thing that
is within my abilities and could also do some good. I gave the guy my name and email but he has not contacted me yet. If I don't
hear from him in a while I initiate contact on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also talked to the lady from Social Coding 4 Good. At first I was skeptical that their service was just a CraigsList for 
free programmers. But she gave me a lot of details and I got the feeling that she personally knows the organizations and 
projects that they promote on the site. I have not yet signed up there but I plan to. It seems that only about 10% of the
people who sign up ever get around to working on a project, but hey I could be one of those 10%!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't have much time to talk to the person who invited me. I was surprised that she was one of the organizers of the Jam, 
not just passing along invitations on Facebook! We gave vague statements to seeing each other again, I hope we do.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Background</title><link href="https://nickfun.github.io/posts/2014/background.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-02-22T23:49:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Nick Fun</name></author><id>tag:https://nickfun.github.io,2014-02-22:posts/2014/background.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Computers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first computer was a Commodore 64. That was released in 1982, but I wasn't even born yet. I had mine
in the early 90s. All our stuff came from garage sales or the discount rack back then. We only used the C64 for
playing games. I remember really enjoying &lt;em&gt;Blue Max&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Archon&lt;/em&gt;. Eventually we got a Windows 95 machine
that we used for schoolwork and games. Mostly Starcraft and doom clones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned HTML from a website that was called &lt;em&gt;HTML Goodies&lt;/em&gt;. It might still be out there. I learned HTML4
and very little CSS. I wasn't really interested in CSS, I've never had success making designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP I also learned on my own buy just reading up various tutorials on the web and spending a lot of time
in the docs section of php.net. Same for MySQL. I wrote some amateur code back in the day, but I think that
these days I write "good" PHP, or about as good as PHP can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some simple stuff, made a few complex things. In my early days I was most proud of a phpMyAdmin-like
app that worked on a flat-file database called TextDB. And, of course, &lt;em&gt;NewLife Blogger&lt;/em&gt;. I'll have to dedicate
a whole page to that one day. It's worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I signed up for a real programming class. I remember Keith Mehl's Intro to C++ class. It was amazing.
The teacher knew everything and had a million stories of being a coder at a real company. I haven't regretted 
becoming a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to make a transition from a PHP dev to a Java dev. Hopefully it all works out for the best!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
