                <p>I believe I first used emacs back in my community college days. I had access to
a Linux machine for a few classes. We often worked in the terminal and I needed
a good text editor. I have tried vi &amp; vim several times, but I could never get
used to the idea of several modes. I would often switch to a different mode
unexpectedly and things would get really bad. I never had <em>that</em> problem with
emacs, so I would usually use emacs.</p>
<p>Eventually, I tried diving in to emacs to see what I could get it to do. I knew
it had a reputation for extensions and while I wasn't planning on writing my own
I wanted to take advantage of anything that was out there. While reading some
docs I found out how to split the window and view two files at the same time.
That was when I decided to never even try vim again and to stay away from nano/pico.</p>
<p>My decision was justified once I learned about org-mode.</p>
<p>At work I have been using Org-mode to keep track of my time. Our bug tracker, Redmine,
lets you log time for how long a bug takes. The boss has asked us to submit a time with
bugs that we close. Org-mode makes it wicked easy to add task, clock in, and generate
a report when needed. I've got a giant file that I've been keeping since the beginning
of the year, 5 months ago. I should look into how to split it into different files.</p>
<h2>Time to go all in</h2>
<p>The other day I saw the "Emacs Rocks" video that showed multiple-cursors mode. I knew then
that it was time to go all-in with emacs. Sublime text has been my main code editor
since at least 2011. I have become very productive in it because of its built-in multi 
cursor support. I had never used a system like that before and it was easy to see
how I could use it to speed up dealing with code in patterns. </p>
<p>I haven't yet taken the time to setup multiple-cursors mode, but I am investing more in 
emacs. I have it setup on my personal computers now. I setup the marmalade repo to 
easily install plug-ins. I have chosen a theme to run with (zenburn) and will try
to move myself into a emacs way of life.</p>
<h2>Emacs Lisp</h2>
<p>I have always wanted to learn Lisp or Scheme. In my Programming Language Concepts class
in University we were given an intro to Scheme. I was pretty blown away by how different
the language was to everything else I had used at that point. I was a pretty good
programmer, but I had trouble wrapping my mind around Scheme. I have wanted to spend
more time with it ever since, and I've never really been able to take it on.</p>
<p>Emacs is famous for having its own Lisp built in: elisp. Sadly, the language is really
old and it has not evolved along with other languages. I understand the variable scope
system is weird in elisp and it has bad support for namespaces. However, I still want
to learn it. It will be profitable for me to learn to extend emacs, and I fill finally
get to learn a lisp! I'm rather excited.</p>
<p>There is a "Intro to elisp" manual that GNU published a few years ago that they give
away for free. I am slowly working through it. I keep a "stuff" repo on GitHub that
I use for experiments. My plan now is that all my experiments will be Emacs oriented.</p>
