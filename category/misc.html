<p>My first computer was a Commodore 64. That was released in 1982, but I wasn't even born yet. I got had mine
in the early 90s. All our stuff came from garage sales or discount rack back then. We only used the C64 for
playing games. I remember really enjoying <em>Blue Max</em> and <em>Archon</em>. Eventually we got a Windows 95 machine
that we used for schoolwork and games. Mostly Starcraft and doom clones.</p>
<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>I learned HTML from a website that was called <em>HTML Goodies</em>. It might still be out there. I learned HTML4
and very little CSS. I wasn't really interested in CSS, I've never had success making designs. </p>
<p>PHP I also learned on my own buy just reading up various tutorials on the web and spending a lot of time
in the docs section of php.net. Same for MySQL.</p>
<p>I made some simple stuff, made a few complex things. In my early days I was most proud of a phpMyAdmin-like
app that worked on a flat-file database called TextDB. And, of course, <em>NewLife Blogger</em>. I'll have to dedicate
a whole page to that one day. It's worth it.</p>
<p>Eventually, I signed up for a real programming class. I remember Keith Mehl's Intro to C++ class. It was amazing.
The teacher knew everything and had a million stories of being a coder at a real company. I haven't regretted 
becoming a software engineer.</p>
<p>I'm trying to make a transition from a PHP dev to a Java dev. Hopefully it all works out for the best!</p>                </article>
